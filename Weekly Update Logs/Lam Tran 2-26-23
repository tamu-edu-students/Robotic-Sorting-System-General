I worked on the Raspberry Pi and the pre-trained model.
I installed the pre-trained model to the Raspberry Pi.
I tested the pre-trained model with a lemon and lime, the model detected it as an orange.
I ordered a new ribbon cable for the Raspberry Pi camera.
I installed Labelimg.
I label some images.
Me and Pace had a meeting with our sponsor to give him an update on our system.
I researched how the pre-trained model works.

My personal plan is to integrate ECEN 403's sensor subsystem with the other subsystems. I will also attend Blitz on Friday to meet with the others. 
During the meeting with our sponsor, he recommend me to trained the model so that it could identify a single fruit first (lemon), then deploy it to the Raspberry Pi to test it.
After that, I will train the model to detect defects of the fruit (black spots, mold, ect), and test it again. 
If I could do this successfully, then I will train the model with another fruit,(maybe limes).
