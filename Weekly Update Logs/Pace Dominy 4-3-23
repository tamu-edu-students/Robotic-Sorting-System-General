With help of Dr Lusher fixed PCB and got output voltage of 4.6V for Raspberry Pi buck converter.  
Voltage divider is wrong and ordered replacement resistor that is 220k Ohms instead of 200k ohms
Tension issue on conveyor belt was fixed by putting cardboard layer on top of rollers and under the belt (only the roller being moved by the motor spins)
Frame of system was spray painted
