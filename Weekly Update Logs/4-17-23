At current stage of the project just fixing any problems with code integration
Cleaned up wiring
Tuned guiding rail timing but the conveyor belt gets moved around everytime its put in the cage
Hopefully do not have to retune timing or reposition starting point of rails everytime it is stored in the cage
Wrote a bash file to run all the python files but didnt work and created a virus (always runs in the background)
Created a python file to run all the python files needed for the project just need to test it
