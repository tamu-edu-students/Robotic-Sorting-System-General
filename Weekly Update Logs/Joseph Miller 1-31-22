I spent yesterday's lab working on implementing a belt control system for my project's Android application.
- I mentioned the bit issue in the previous update - I fixed that at home over the previous week.
- I also spent some time working on improving the UI, but ran into some issues with the project's dependencies.
- I'll be working on fixing that over the next week.
