Conveyor belt frame finished
Need to build guiding rails
PCB motor controllers work with PSU attached
Accidentaly fried some componenets when connecting PSU ground and power connectors backwards during the ecen design blitz.
Ordered components to replace the ones that heated up or smoked
Plan to fix PCB, finish conveyor belt and guiding rails and start integrating this week once board is fixed
