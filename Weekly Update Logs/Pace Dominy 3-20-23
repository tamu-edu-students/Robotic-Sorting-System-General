Conveyor belt built but belt not tensioning enough to get lemon over rollers
Guiding arm pulley works just need to connect arms
Motor controller code takes input from database that app and sensors use...when the database updates it checks to see if it needs to move or not and takes action.
Load cells connect with PCB and Raspberry Pi and work
Need to fix belt tensioning issue...connect guiding arms asap...make bins for load cells...wire everything together permanently
