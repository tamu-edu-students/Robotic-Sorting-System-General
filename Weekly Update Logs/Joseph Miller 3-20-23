This week, we were able to get all of the subsystems writing to and reading from the same file, effectively allowing them to talk to each other. I also helped a bit with fabricating the mechanical aspects of the project.
I'm concerned about our progress on integration, especially since we're sinking so much effort into machine learning, but we've started talking to Dr. Lusher to help find a way forward.
