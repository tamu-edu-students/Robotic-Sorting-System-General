Previous week, I worked on the Raspberry Pi and researching ML.

I talked to Dr. Lusher if I could use a pre-trained model and said it's fine to use it.

I tested my color/size sensors with the new test items and some fruits.
The items that I used are pieces of plywood, painted with different colors and have different dimensions. 
Some of the fruits that I tested were lime, lemon, tangerine, granny smith apple, banana, and eggplant.
For the size sensor, there seems to be an around 10 percent increase in dimensions compared to the actual size for certain objects. 
For other objects, there is a 5 percent increase.
For the color sensor, all of the colors from the hue range worked ideally except for violet.
For the violent/purple object, there seems to be a good amount of red and blue that the sensor measured.
I tested and validated my color/size sensor, so I believe it is ready to be integrated to the other subsystems.
For the size sensor, once we have an actual stand for the camera, I believe it will take more accurate and precise measurements.
For the color sensor, I believe there are no citrus fruits that are violent/purple. 


I tested my weight sensor with 3 load cells.
First, I tested a load cell individually. Then I tested them simultaneously.
The Raspberry Pi can take measurements from the 3 load cells simultaneously.
I tested and validated my weight sensor, so I believe it is ready to be integrated to the other subsystems.

My personal plan is to integrate ECEN 403's sensor subsystem with the other subsystems. 
I will also follow this Tensorflow guide on Youtube ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNjXEybFn98&list=PLQY2H8rRoyvz_anznBg6y3VhuSMcpN9oe ) to set up a pre trained model to the raspberry pi and test it. 
I will label my data images, and train the model with the new images. I will then test the model again with the raspberry pi.
