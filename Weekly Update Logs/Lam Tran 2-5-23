2/5
Previous week, I worked on the Raspberry Pi to integrate color and size sensor code.
I finished coding the color and size sensor code to the Raspberry Pi.
I coded a python program that can take an image from the Raspberry Pi Camera, (without creating errors or other problems)
I did some testing with the color and size sensor. These include testing with different camera heights to minimize distortions and adjusting lighting to prevent noises.
It seems that the best height for the Raspberry Pi Camera is 15 inches.

I also worked on my weight sensor to reduce noise.
I changed my weight sensor code, so that the program averages the last 12 readings.
I changed my weight sensor code, so that it could take the reading from different 2 load cells. 
I did some testing with the weight sensor. 
These include adding a capacitor to see if noise from the reading will reduce, and also averaging the last 12 readings to see if it gives a stable averaged reading.  

My team and I scheduled with our sponsor to clarify the requirements of the Robotic Sorting System. 
One takeaway from that meeting is implementing machine learning to detect scarrings on the fruit, which wasn't originally part of the design back in ECEN 403.

My personal plan is to update my FSR, ICD, and other documents. 
I also plan on going to office hours to talk about if I should implement machine learning to my subsystem,  and if I have time to implement it. 
I am currenting taking ECEN 289 which is a machine learning class, so I will talk to my professor about it. 
I also plan to test my color/size sensor with objects of different colors and sizes.
I also plan to test my weight sensor with 2 load cell reading.
