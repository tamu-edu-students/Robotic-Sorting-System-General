This week, I've still been working on getting the Bluetooth server to update when the common variable file updates.
I've had a lot of trouble trying to get this to work, but may have identified a solution and I'll be reaching out for help as well going into Blitz.

Going forward, I'll try to resolve this issue and move forward with integration with other subsystems as they come online, especially during Blitz.
