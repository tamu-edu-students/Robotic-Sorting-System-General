3/26

I worked on mostly integration for this week.
My team and I emailed Dr. Lusher about my struggle to create a working model, other problems and what to do next. He emailed back telling us to focus on integrations. Once finished with that, I could continue working on ML.
I retested my weight sensor on the breadboard to see if my code and design still work.
I reprogrammed my size sensor code to update Joseph's JSON file
I helped to wire up the Pace's conveyor system to the load cells and Raspberry Pi.
I tested my weight sensor on Pace's PCB. It still has some weird readings, but me and Pace talked about some solutions to make the system work with the weird readings.
I programmed my color/size code to work with the Pace's black conveyor belt. I may have found a way to filter out bright spots and uneven lighting. 


My personal plan for this week.
Finish with integration of our subsystems. Like error value or testing the camera on the conveyor, ect.
Finish with system validations.
Create a new machine learning model, with "good lemon" and "bad lemon" as the labels.
