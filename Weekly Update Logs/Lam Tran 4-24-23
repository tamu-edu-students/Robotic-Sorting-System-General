4/24

My team and I worked on integration mostly. I also collected some data for my weight sensor.
I tested and collected data that was used to convert the ADC unit to grams of the weight sensor. 
Somehow, I accidentally fried the Raspberry Pi while I was testing it.
A TA was there and told me that I could borrow another Raspberry Pi from Wisebaker.
Once I got the new Raspberry Pi, I tested to see if the micro SD still works. It still works, so our files are still there.
We tried to use multithreading to have our python scripts run simultaneously, but it seems to only run the color/size sensor code only. 
For the demo, we ended up running each of our code one at a time.

My personal plan for this week. 
Work on my part on the poster.
Present our Robotic Sorting System during the Engineering Project Showcase.
Work on the Final report
