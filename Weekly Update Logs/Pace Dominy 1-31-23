Over the past two weeks I...
-redesigned my PCB
-Ordered the new PCB and some extra components
-Completed basic solidworks design for conveyor belt and guidance rails
-Updated main FSR and ICD as well as my subsystem specific ones to take out anything that was too specific and/or uneeded (out of scope for a prototype)
