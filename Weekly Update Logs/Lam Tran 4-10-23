4/10

I worked on mostly integration, validating the integration, and some on ML.
I have trained my model. I also deployed and tested my ML model. The results are way better than my previous model, but it is not perfect. Once I am done with integrating my subsystem, I will train another model with better data.I tested my subsystem integration with Joseph's Bluetooth subsystem. The Bluetooth subsystem seems to not like passing values that are negative, have decimal, and that are large. TheTo fix this problem, I will have to transfer data to the JSON with integers 0 to 255.For integration, Pace wanted me to modify my codes to run continuously while taking data and importing the data to the JSON file. I did this to my weight sensor code, showed it off to him, and he thinks it's good.I also integrated my ML model to update the JSON file.
My personal plan for this week.Modify my code to run continuously, have it update sensor measurements, update the JSON file with a way to make it work with the Bluetooth.Calibrate the weight sensor, so that it could output an actual weight unit like Kg.Finish with system validations.Have a finished working system by the end of the week.If I have the time, train the model, test/validate the model, and if I have time, integrate the model with the system.
