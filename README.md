# Robotic Sorting System (General)
General files (such as presentations) related to the Robotic Sorting System project. The Robotic Sorting System is the senior design project of Pace Dominy, Joseph Miller, and Lam Tran.

Note that due to the interaction of Android development tools with GitHub, the source code for the Android application subsystem can be found in a separate repository (https://github.com/tamu-edu-students/Robotic-Sorting-System-Android-App).
